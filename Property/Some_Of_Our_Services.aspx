                                                <p>Here are some of the steps I will take to help you find your dream home:</p>

                                                <h2>1. Determine your needs and wants</h2>
                                                <p>By determining exactly what you are looking for in a home, we will be able to glide through the home buying process. This will allow us to be more efficient by only searching for properties that fit your criteria.</p>

                                                <h2>2. Helping you get pre-qualified financing</h2>
                                                <p>This is another crucial step in the home buying process. I will assist you in getting a pre-qualified mortgage. This is important as it shows how much you can afford, and what your estimated monthly payments will be. As well, it shows your seriousness which will give you an edge when making an offer to a seller.</p>

                                                <h2>3. Home Shopping</h2>

Using your specific criteria and parameters, we will be able to narrow down the search and gather other important information that may affect your decision. Once you are ready to move forward, I will help you write an offer to the seller, keeping your best interests in mind.</p>
